# Survivors_of_titanic

### Overview
This is a tutorial in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. The goal of this repository is to provide an example of a competitive analysis for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions .

### Libraries required
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

### Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

### This Notebook shows:
Data Handling
Importing Data with Pandas

### Cleaning Data
Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

### Data Analysis
Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Logit Regression Model + Plotting results + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results

### Valuation of the Analysis
K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
